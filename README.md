# Semantic segmentation 
Semantic segmentation  refers to the process of linking each pixel in an image to a class label. These labels could include a person, car, flower, piece of furniture, etc., just to mention a few. We can think of semantic segmentation as image classification at a pixel level.


If you want to use a custom dataset while also reusing detectron2â€™s data loaders, you will need to

Optionally, register metadata for your dataset.
Next, we explain the above two concepts in details.

The Colab Notebook has a working example of how to register and train on a dataset of custom formats.
